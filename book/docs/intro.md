# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the future of work, where humans and robots collaborate seamlessly. This book is designed to provide a comprehensive foundation in the fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike pure software AI (like LLMs or search engines), Physical AI must interact with the real world, sense its environment, and perform physical actions.

### Key Components of Physical AI
- **Perception**: Sensing the world through cameras, LIDAR, and tactile sensors.
- **Cognition**: Reasoning and decision-making using advanced AI models.
- **Actuation**: Translating decisions into physical movements through motors and joints.

## The Rise of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are designed to mimic the human form. This design is not just for aesthetic reasons; our world is built for humans. Stairs, door handles, and tools are all optimized for the human body. By creating humanoid robots, we enable them to operate in these same environments without requiring major infrastructure changes.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will understand:
1. The hardware architecture of humanoid robots.
2. How to implement perception systems using AI.
3. The kinematics and dynamics of bipedal locomotion.
4. How to integrate AI agents to control physical hardware.
