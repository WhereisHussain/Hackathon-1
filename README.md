## ✨ Features

### 1. AI-Native Content
- 5 comprehensive chapters covering Humanoid Architecture, Kinematics, Sensing, Actuation, and AI Software Agents.
- Rich technical content with integrated code examples and mathematical foundations.

### 2. Integrated RAG Chatbot
- **Contextual Understanding**: A floating chatbot powered by **OpenAI Agents SDK** and **Qdrant Vector Store**.
- **Interactive Retrieval**: Highlight specific text in the book, and the chatbot will use that context to answer your questions accurately.

### 3. Personalized Learning
- **Custom Profiles**: Captures user hardware and software background during signup.
- **Dynamic Content**: Press **"Personalize for Me"** at the start of any chapter to have the AI adapt the technical complexity and analogies to your specific background.

### 4. Accessibility: Urdu Translation
- **One-Click Translation**: Every chapter can be translated into Urdu at the press of a button, ensuring that cutting-edge robotics knowledge is accessible to everyone.

### 5. Reusable Intelligence (Agent Skills)
- **Summarization**: Instantly generate key takeaways for any chapter.
- **Explain Code**: Specialized agent skill for explaining robotics control loops and ROS2 code.
- **Kinematics Tutor**: Step-by-step guidance for solving rigid body physics problems.
